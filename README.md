# Snake

If you remember game Snake, it means that you're old :-) If no, check it out on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDbTP0B94AM).

I've developed this game in Eclipse using [Processing3](https://processing.org/) library. 

I was working with Processing some time ago when I start learning Java, it was fun to try it once again. My previous project was [EarthquakeMap](https://github.com/marekbodziony/Module6_EarthquakeMap).

Here you can download jar file with different versions of the game : 
1) [snake1.jar](https://github.com/marekbodziony/Snake/raw/master/Snake1.jar) (1 player, no borders), 
2) [snake1b.jar](https://github.com/marekbodziony/Snake/raw/master/Snake1b.jar) (1 player, with borders) 
3) [snake2.jar](https://github.com/marekbodziony/Snake/raw/master/Snake2.jar) (two players, no borders).
